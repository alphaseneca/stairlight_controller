# stairlight_controller

This GitHub repository houses the code and documentation for a Two-Way Passive Infrared (PIR) Stairlight Controller. The controller incorporates PIR sensors to detect motion in both ascending and descending directions, ensuring that the stairlights illuminate when needed and conserve energy when not in use.

## Schematic

The schematic for the device connection is shown below.
